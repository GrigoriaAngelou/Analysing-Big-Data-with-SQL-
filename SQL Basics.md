# The basics of SQL

## What is SQL?
Structured Query Language (SQL) refers to a standard programming language utilized to extract, organize, manage, and manipulate data stored in relational databases.
SQL is thereby referred to as a database language that can execute activities on databases that consist of tables made up of rows and columns.

## Elements of SQL
SQL is the go-to-choice of most database users due to its easy usability and how the queries can carry out varied functions on vast amounts of structured data.

SQL programming language has the following vital elements:

**1. Keywords:** Keywords refer to a set of words that allow you to perform operations on your database.

Examples of such keywords with their functional roles:
<span style="color: green">
* CREATE: This keyword helps in creating a database structure or simply tables, views, and an index
* INSERT: It adds data to the rows of a table
* SELECT: Selects data from database or table
* FROM: Indicates the table from which data needs to be fetched
* WHERE: It filters the data so that only relevant data matching certain conditions is fetched
* UPDATE: Updates existing rows in a table
* DELETE: It deletes the existing rows in a table 
</span>

**2. Clauses:** Clauses refer to the in-built functions that filter out data and retrieve the required data from the database or table.

**3. Expressions:** SQL expressions represent a formula typically written in a query format. It combines one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluate a specific value. Moreover, SQL expressions are broadly divided into three types, namely, Boolean, numeric, and date.

**4. Predicates:** Predicates refer to keywords that reveal a relationship between two expressions and result in a true or false value. It is just another term for an expression that is used to determine an unknown or TRUE/FALSE condition.

**5. Queries:** SQL queries refer to statements used to request or retrieve data from a database.

## Basic Database Operations
**Data Definition Language (DDL):** SQL uses commands to create and maintain databases such as **CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE,** and **COMMENT.**

**Data Query Language (DQL):** This refers to SQL commands used to retrieve data from databases. The commonly used SQL command here is **SELECT.**

**Data Manipulation Language (DML):** These refer to SQL commands used to manipulate data and perform critical operations on databases, such as **INSERT, UPDATE,** and **DELETE.**

**Data Control Language (DCL):** These refer to SQL control commands that grant users permission or access to perform certain operations. For example, **REVOKE** is the control command that revokes the access permission given to users.

## UNION and JOIN commands

SQL uses **UNION** and **JOIN** commands to merge two tables in a database to provide a single result or output. 

JOIN is further divided into four types:

* INNER JOIN
* LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
* RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
* FULL (OUTER) JOIN
