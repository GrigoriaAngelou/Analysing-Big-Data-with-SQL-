## What is SQL?
Structured Query Language (SQL) refers to a standard programming language utilized to extract, organize, manage, and manipulate data stored in relational databases.
SQL is thereby referred to as a database language that can execute activities on databases that consist of tables made up of rows and columns.

## Elements of SQL
SQL is the go-to-choice of most database users due to its easy usability and how the queries can carry out varied functions on vast amounts of structured data.

SQL programming language has the following vital elements:

**1. Keywords:** Keywords refer to a set of words that allow you to perform operations on your database.

Examples of such keywords with their functional roles:
```diff
@@
CREATE: This keyword helps in creating a database structure or simply tables, views, and an index
INSERT: It adds data to the rows of a table
SELECT: Selects data from database or table
FROM: Indicates the table from which data needs to be fetched
WHERE: It filters the data so that only relevant data matching certain conditions is fetched
UPDATE: Updates existing rows in a table
DELETE: It deletes the existing rows in a table @@
```
**2. Clauses:** Clauses refer to the in-built functions that filter out data and retrieve the required data from the database or table.

**3. Expressions:** SQL expressions represent a formula typically written in a query format. It combines one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluate a specific value. Moreover, SQL expressions are broadly divided into three types, namely, Boolean, numeric, and date.

**4. Predicates:** Predicates refer to keywords that reveal a relationship between two expressions and result in a true or false value. It is just another term for an expression that is used to determine an unknown or TRUE/FALSE condition.

**5. Queries:** SQL queries refer to statements used to request or retrieve data from a database.
