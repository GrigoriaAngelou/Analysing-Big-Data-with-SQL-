SQL is the go-to-choice of most database users due to its easy usability and how the queries can carry out varied functions on vast amounts of structured data.

SQL programming language has the following vital elements:

**1. Keywords:** Keywords refer to a set of words that allow you to perform operations on your database.

**2. Clauses:** Clauses refer to the in-built functions that filter out data and retrieve the required data from the database or table.

**3. Expressions:** SQL expressions represent a formula typically written in a query format. It combines one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluate a specific value. Moreover, SQL expressions are broadly divided into three types, namely, Boolean, numeric, and date.

**4. Predicates:** Predicates refer to keywords that reveal a relationship between two expressions and result in a true or false value. It is just another term for an expression that is used to determine an unknown or TRUE/FALSE condition.

**5. Queries:** SQL queries refer to statements used to request or retrieve data from a database.
